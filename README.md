mackerel-plugin-aws-billing
=======================

# Overview
mackerel-plugin-aws-billing is mackerel agent plugin that gets AWS cost and makes a graph.

## Description

It uses [AWS CloudWatch Api](https://aws.amazon.com/ja/documentation/cloudwatch/) to get AWS Billing Data related to AWS Account.  
It can make a graph on [Service Metric](https://mackerel.io/ja/features/service-metrics/).  
It gets AWS cost every hour by using AWS API because unlike other metrics, AWS updates cost once in a few hours.  
It writes cache file on server every hour, and uses cache to output data.  

(â€»In order to output data to Service Metric, this plugin sends data to mackerel instead of mackerel-agent because mackerel-agent can not send data to Service Metric.)  

Caution: You must must enable Billing Alerts.(see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/monitor-charges.html)
